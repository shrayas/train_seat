train_seat.c
========
Quick C program to tell u , given the seat number , which berth u are in . Its a program designed for 3 tier sleepers (thats what i travel in , yeah i'm selfish :P)

It comes of use mostly when we are just given seat numbers (e tickets , i think , or something of that sort)

So, what should i do ?
